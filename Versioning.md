# Versioning Workflow (GitHub)
1) **Upload & commit** new files to `main` (Add file → Upload files → Commit).
2) **Create release** with tag `vX.Y.Z` pointing to `main` (Releases → Draft a new release).
3) **Pages** should serve `main` (Settings → Pages).
Rollback: Revert the bad commit or create a branch from a prior tag and point Pages to it.
